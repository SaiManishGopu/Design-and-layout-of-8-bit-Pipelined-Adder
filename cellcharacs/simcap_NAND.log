*******************************************
AC Analysis `Freq': freq = (10 Hz -> 1 GHz)
*******************************************

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `Freq'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.
        dV(X1.net1) = 3.52102 mV
        Use the `gmin_check' option to eliminate or expand this report.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

DC simulation time: CPU = 686 us, elapsed = 723.124 us.
